The idea is to simplify mothering wp and all the crap around it that loves to do things that come in the way of proxy caching.

I'm not a fan of php and (I just won't comment on WordProut) so please feel free to suggest better ways of doing things in php/wp marvelous world.

Started writing after soddenly site started spitting 'no-cache' under heavy load so I need something reliable.

This is in scaffolding stage (pre-alpha)
